## Description  
This project provides a reusable template to kickstart machine learning workflows. Designed for scalability, modularity, and production readiness, it features:  
- Clear pipeline-based architecture for training and prediction.  
- REST API and web applications for serving predictions.  
- Robust testing for ensuring reliability.  

---

## Features  
- Modular pipelines for data ingestion, transformation, model selection, and prediction.  
- REST API and Flask-based web UI for prediction services.  
- Logging and error handling with customizable configurations.  
- Comprehensive test suite with coverage reports.  

---

## Datasets  
- **Source**: [Provide dataset source here, e.g., Hugging Face Dataset Library]  
- **Preprocessing**: Includes normalization, handling missing values, and feature engineering.  
- **Licensing**: [Specify dataset licensing details here]  

---

## Model  
- **Algorithms**: Implements `Random Forest`, `Linear Regression`, `XGBoost`, `CatBoost`, and more.  
- **Hyperparameters**: Configurable via YAML/JSON files.  
- **Evaluation**: Selects the best model based on R² scores across various algorithms.  

---

## Results  
- **Performance Metrics**:  
  - Random Forest: R² = 0.845  
  - Linear Regression: R² = 0.885  
  - XGBoost: R² = 0.875  
- **Artifacts**:  
  - Best Model: Saved as `model.pkl` in the `artifacts/` directory.  
  - Preprocessor: Saved as `preprocessor.pkl`.  

---

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd ml_project_template
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac  
   venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows  
   ```  

---

## Usage  
The project supports two primary workflows:  
1. Data Ingestion (Download & Prepare Datasets)  
2. Model Training (Train ML Models)  

These workflows can be executed via command-line arguments.

---

### 1. Running Data Ingestion  
To ingest data, use the following command:
```bash
python launch.py ingest --config config/ingestion_config.yaml --debug
```
#### Available Options
| Argument  | Description | Default |
|------------|------------|---------|
| `--config` | (Optional) Path to ingestion configuration file | None |
| `--debug` | (Optional) Enable debug mode | `False` |

---

### 2. Running Model Training  
To train a model, run:
```bash
python launch.py train --config config/model_config.yaml --debug
```
#### Available Options
| Argument  | Description | Default |
|------------|------------|---------|
| `--config` | (Optional) Path to training configuration file | `config/model_config.yaml` |
| `--debug` | (Optional) Enable debug mode | `False` |
| `--model-type` | (Optional) Specify one or more models to train (e.g., `"RandomForest DecisionTree"`) | Runs all models if not provided |
| `--best-of-all` | (Optional) If set, overrides `--model-type` and trains all models to find the best one | `False` |
| `--save-best` | (Optional) If set, saves the best-performing model after training | `False` |

---

### Example Runs  
- Run data ingestion with a custom config file:  
  ```bash
  python launch.py ingest --config my_custom_ingestion.yaml
  ```  
- Run model training in debug mode:  
  ```bash
  python launch.py train --debug
  ```  
- Train a specific model (e.g., CatBoost and Linear Regression):  
  ```bash
  python launch.py train --model-type "CatBoosting Regressor" "Linear Regression"
  ```  
- Train all models and pick the best one automatically:  
  ```bash
  python launch.py train --best-of-all
  ```  
- Train all models and save the best one:  
  ```bash
  python launch.py train --best-of-all --save-best
  ```  

---

### Notes
- If no `--config` is provided, default configurations will be used.
- If `--model-type` is not provided, all models will be trained.
- Using `--best-of-all` will override `--model-type` and automatically determine the best model.
- The `--save-best` flag ensures that the best model is stored after training.
- The script logs all activity for debugging and monitoring.

---

## Configuration  
- **Logging**: Configurable via environment variables (`LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_JSON`).  
- **Hyperparameters**: Adjustable in `config/params.yaml`.  
- **Artifacts Directory**: Defined in `config/pipeline.yaml`.
